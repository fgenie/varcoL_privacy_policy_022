Privacy Policy for varcoL

Effective Date: starting from May 15, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how varcoL ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects the limited information provided by users.

1. What Information We Collect

The Extension collects only voluntary user feedback in the form of a good or bad preference regarding the Extension's functionality or user experience.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, Browse history, or any other sensitive data. The feedback is collected anonymously.

2. How We Collect Information

The feedback is collected directly from you when you voluntarily choose to provide it through the Extension's user interface (e.g., clicking a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" button, or submitting a simple feedback form within the extension).

3. Purpose of Data Collection

The sole purpose of collecting this voluntary feedback is to understand user satisfaction and to improve the Extension based on user preferences.

4. How We Use Your Information

The feedback (the good/bad preference) is used in an aggregated and anonymized form to analyze overall user sentiment and identify areas for improvement in the Extension. For example, we might track the percentage of users who reported a "good" experience versus a "bad" experience over time.

Individual feedback responses are not linked to specific users.

5. Data Sharing

We do not share your voluntary feedback with any third parties.

The feedback is used solely for internal purposes to guide the development and improvement of the Extension.

6. Data Storage and Security

The collected feedback data is stored securely. While the data collected is not personal or sensitive, we take reasonable precautions to protect it. [Optional: You can add a brief statement about your security measures, e.g., "The data is stored on secure servers and accessed only for the stated purpose."].

7. Data Retention

We retain the aggregated and anonymized feedback data for as long as necessary to analyze trends and inform development decisions.

8. User Rights

Since we do not collect personally identifiable information and the feedback is anonymous, individual feedback responses cannot be accessed, modified, or deleted by specific users. Your provision of feedback is entirely voluntary, and you can simply choose not to provide it.

9. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. 1  When we make significant changes, we 2  will post the revised policy and notify you through an in-Extension update or notice. Your continued use of the Extension after being notified of significant changes and, where required, providing your consent, constitutes your agreement to the updated policy. If you do not consent to significant changes, the Extension may be deactivated or its functionality limited. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time for any updates.
